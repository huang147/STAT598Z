# count the number of rows
# code: 
wc dummy.txt -l 
# output: 
4 dummy.txt


# count the number of columns 
# code: 
tr '|' ' ' < dummy.txt | head -n 1 | wc -w
# output:
4


# count the total number of entries in matrix
# code: 
tr -d '|' < dummy.txt | wc -w
# delete all the delimiter '|', then count the number of words in the file
# output: 
16


# display the element a11
# code: 
head -n 1 dummy.txt | tr -d ' ' | cut -d '|' -f 2
# get the first line, delete all the spaces, then cut the file using '|' as delimiter
# output: 
1


# display the element ann
# code: 
tail -n 1 dummy.txt | tr -d ' ' | cut -f `tail -n 1 dummy.txt | tr -s ' ' '\n' | grep -c '|'` -d '|'
# tail -n 1 dummy.txt | tr -d ' ' | grep -o '|' | wc -l
# the command right above is first take the last row, delete the spaces, then count the number of '|' delimiters
# then this code is encapsulated into `` and get executed, the result is 5, which is the index of the last element
# then the result 5 is used in the pipe below:
# tail -n 1 dummy.txt | tr -d ' ' | cut -f 5 -d '|'
# first take the last row, delete the spaces, then cut the last field and get the last element
# output: 
16
